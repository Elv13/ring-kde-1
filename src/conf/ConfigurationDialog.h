   This class represents the config dialog for sflphone.
   It uses the ConfigurationSkeleton class to handle most of the settings.
   It inherits KConfigDialog with the pages defined in dlg... files.
   A few complicated settings are handled directly by its pages.
   Some custom behaviors have been added to handle specific cases,
   as this config dialog is not the usual kind.
   A few things might be done a cleaner way by passing the handling 
   to the skeleton like it has been done with codecs.
