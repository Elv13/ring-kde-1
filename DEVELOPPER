From now on, those coding guideline must be applied to prevent more fragmentation of the coding style:
-Class name must start with a caps
-Funtion and variables names must -not- start with a caps
-Words in functions must be separated by caps "addNewCall"
-Pointer symbol should be merge with the type QWidget* aWidget
-Indentation must be 3 (three) -space- wide, every IDE have options to set that
-Classes and functions bracket must look like:
   void MyClass::myFunction()
   {

   }
-If, while, case and for most look like this:
   if () {

   }
   else {

   }
-One line if without braces are allowed
-The .h HAVE TO BE COMMENTED following the doxygen syntax
-"Autoconnect" functions are allowed
-Qt STL and macro are recommaded
-KDE class are prefered over pure Qt classes
