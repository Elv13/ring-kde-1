Description:

        Read this if you want to know how to build SFLPhone
        using TrollTech's qmake.

        Why have qmake enter the picture? Frankly; I find the
        GNU auto tools to be a great idea - if you never have
        to figure them out. However, the GNU auto-tools are 
	not a simple solution for OSX and Windows users.

Requirements:

        Guess what? You are going to need qmake. If you have
        Qt installed then you probably already have qmake
        installed. If not then go to www.trolltech.com and 
        get it. If you're on a Linux system, it is probably
	already included in your distribution.

        I recommend getting the whole Qt C++ class library. It
        is large and takes quite awhile to build but once complete
        you will have the tiny qmake program AND everything you
        need to build the cool GUI stuff included in SFLPhone.
        
Make & Install:

        The qmake project files have .pro extensions. You may want
        to edit them to your liking. 

        Here are the steps to build using qmake;
        
        1. $ qmake
        2. $ make
        
        Currently; these qmake project files lack an install but... 

        You can copy the binary (sflphone) to your PATH or copy it
        somewhere like /usr/local/bin. The binary is self-sufficient.
